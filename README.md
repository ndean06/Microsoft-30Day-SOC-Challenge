# Microsoft 30-Day SOC Challenge

A 30-day journey through real-world SOC workflows using Microsoft Sentinel, Microsoft Defender XDR, Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Office, and Entra ID Protection.

This challenge helped me practice:
- Threat hunting with KQL  
- Incident investigation across identity, email, and endpoint  
- Writing structured IR reports  
- Building detections, dashboards, and workflows
