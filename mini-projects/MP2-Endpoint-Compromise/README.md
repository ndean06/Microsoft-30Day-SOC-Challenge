# Mini Project 2 – Endpoint Compromise Analysis

## Objective

Investigate suspicious endpoint behavior to determine whether a host was compromised, identify attacker actions, and assess impact using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint telemetry.

## Scenario Overview

Defender for Endpoint generated alerts indicating suspicious process execution and abnormal behavior on a Windows host. This investigation focused on validating the alert, analyzing execution chains, and determining whether the activity represented a true endpoint compromise.

The project simulates a Tier 1–Tier 2 SOC analyst workflow for endpoint triage and investigation.

## Investigation Focus

- Process execution and parent-child relationships

- Suspicious binaries and command-line activity

- Endpoint telemetry correlation

- MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

- Microsoft Defender XDR

- Advanced Hunting (KQL)

- MITRE ATT&CK Framework
