\# Mini Project 3 – Conditional Access \& Identity Attack Simulation



\## Objective

Simulate a foreign login attempt to evaluate Conditional Access enforcement and identity risk detection using Entra ID Protection.



\## Scenario Overview

This project simulates a sign-in from an unexpected geographic location to test how identity protections respond to risky authentication events. The investigation validates alerting, policy enforcement, and visibility into identity-based threats.



This mirrors real-world SOC validation of identity controls and zero-trust access policies.



\## Investigation Focus

\- Risky sign-in detection

\- Impossible travel indicators

\- Conditional Access policy enforcement

\- Identity log analysis



\## Tools Used

\- Entra ID Protection

\- Microsoft Defender XDR

\- Microsoft Sentinel

\- Advanced Hunting (KQL)



\## Walkthrough

Step-by-step investigation and validation of identity protections are documented here:

\## Screenshots

All screenshots and evidence from the identity attack simulation are stored in the `/screenshots` directory.
