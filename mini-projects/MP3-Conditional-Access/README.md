# Mini Project 3 – Conditional Access & Identity Attack Simulation

## Objective

Simulate a foreign login attempt to evaluate Conditional Access enforcement and identity risk detection using Entra ID Protection.

## Scenario Overview

This project simulates a sign-in from an unexpected geographic location to test how identity protections respond to risky authentication events. The investigation validates alerting, policy enforcement, and visibility into identity-based threats.

The investigation simulates a SOC analyst validating identity-based threats before endpoint compromise occurs.

## Incident Type
Identity Threat – Risky Sign-In / Conditional Access Enforcement

### Technical Walkthrough
Step-by-step identity investigation using Entra ID sign-in logs, Conditional Access evaluation, and risk indicators.

→ [README.md](README.md)

## Investigation Focus

- Risky sign-in detection
- Conditional Access policy enforcement
- Sign-in log analysis (location, IP, device)
- Identity risk vs successful authentication
- Pre-endpoint attack prevention

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)

- Conditional Access

- Microsoft Defender XDR

- Sign-in Logs

- Entra ID Protection

- Microsoft Sentinel

- Advanced Hunting (KQL)

## Outcome
*(To be completed after walkthrough)*

The simulated foreign login was **<blocked / challenged / logged>** by Conditional Access. No endpoint activity occurred, demonstrating effective identity-layer controls.
