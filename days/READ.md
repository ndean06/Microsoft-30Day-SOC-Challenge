# Daily Challenge Logs

This folder contains my day-by-day notes and lab work from the **Microsoft 30-Day SOC Challenge**.

Each file documents the tools, queries, alerts, and investigation steps completed on that specific day. These daily logs show how individual SOC skills were developed incrementally and later applied to full incident investigations.

The work in this folder directly supports the four mini projects highlighted in the root README. For complete investigations, formal incident reports, and polished deliverables, see the **mini-projects/** directory.
